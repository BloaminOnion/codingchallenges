This is a place for me to practice and improve my coding abilities.  I will initially focus on C++ and Python, undertaking challenges from the book "The Modern C++ Challenge".  Eventually I would like to move on to using more languages (e.g. Java and Haskell), as well as problems from other sources (e.g. the Project Euler problems).
